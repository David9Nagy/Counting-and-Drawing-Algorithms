This repository contains 3 algorithms written in Assembly, which can be built upon or used to gain familiarity with how simple algorithms can be written in Assembly. 
The algorithms assume certain values are stored in certain registers as noted. 

calculate_gcd finds the greatest common denominator of two values.

count_negative_nums finds the number of negative integers in an array

draw_shapes draws lines and rectangles by populating certain registers with values according to which pixels are being drawn. 
This code assumes that a display interface with the proper resolution is set up correctly as noted in the code.
